# chip8-ts
A CHIP-8 emulator written in TypeScript.

## Why?
Just for fun :) I wanted to learn more about how emulators work and how they are implemented.
So I started with researching an easy beginner friendly emulator to implement and found the CHIP-8.
I plan on first finishing this implementation in Typescript (I chose typescript because of the easy
web compatibility and typing) and then porting it to Rust later on (With the goal of learning Rust).
Later on I plan to move on to a GameBoy emulator.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `bash bundle.sh`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
